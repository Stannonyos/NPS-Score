# Net Promoter Score with Python

Net Promoter Score (NPS) is an indicator that measures customers' loyalty. It can be used alongside other customer measurement indicators such as customer satisfaction index and brand health index.

The higher the NPS score, the greater the loyalty customers have towards a company, brand, service etc.

To come up with the score, one need to ask one question. The question is mostly framed as "On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend [name of business] to a friend?‚Äù

During analysis you get:
- #Detractors, i.e. who give responses (0-6). They are not likely to recommend the company. Worse, they are likely to a give a bad review.
- #Passives, i.e. give responses (7-8).They are fence sitters who are not sure on whether to recommend.
- #Promoters, i.e. give responses (9-10). They wont hesitate in giving a recommendation.

We calculate NPS as #NPS=%promoters-%detractors.This implies that NPS can be negative- when there are more detractors than promoters.

With NPS, companies can initiate strategies of how to retain promoters, win confidence of the passives, and if the percentage of detractors is too high,companies can strategise on new ways of tapping into the detractors market.

Further statistics could be performed with NPS, like crosstabulation of NPS by demographic variables such as gender, location, etc. Modelling the drivers of NPS could still be performed using logistic and log linear regressions.

In my example, I have generated NPS of three companies i.e. A, B, C. The data used was generated through simulating responses of 
387 cases. 
For the responses, I randomized responses (1-10) based on proportions. It is noted that this was necessary for if such was not done, it is highly likely that most responses would have been (0-6) i.e. detractors as the data is random.
